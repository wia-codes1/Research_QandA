# Project Overview

The goal of this project was to implement **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for document processing and query handling. The objective was to create a system that combines document retrieval and generation to provide accurate, context-aware responses to research-related queries.

Using **Google Generative AI Embeddings** and **FAISS** for document retrieval, and **Gemini 2.5 Flash** for response generation, the system processes research papers, retrieves relevant chunks of information, and generates answers grounded in the provided context. This approach ensures that answers are both **factually accurate** and **citation-backed**, making the system a useful tool for research assistants.

The project aimed to combine **RAG**, **machine learning**, and **natural language processing** techniques to improve document understanding and automate the research query process.
